I was casually browsing X (formerly Twitter) and trying to improve my understanding of programming. There is one person whom I consider as one of the best Rustaceans I know, [Adam Chalmers](https://x.com/adam_chal), who reposted a tweet saying aspiring devs should blog about their learning. Although I agree with him, I said the thought of creating a blog site stops me from doing so. He simply said to use a template engine like `zola` and `cloudflare pages` for hosting and you should be good to go.

That is when this thought came to my mind: "I just need to write. Eventually I can move my old blogs to a new blogging site, if I ever create one!" 

Starting from tomorrow, I am working on an ML research project. I'm super excited to write more about it.

Here we are, wandering and reading about my vague understanding of programming.
